Suppose you find yourself in a very silly country, where all transactions must be made in cash, and there are only three denominations of currency: $435'812, $47'125, and $1'159'171.  What is the smallest positive amount you can possibly pay for with these denominations, assuming you are allowed to get change?  Just write the number, excluding the dollar sign.
For example: If the denominations were $25 and $20, then the smallest amount you could pay for would be $5 (so your answer would be 5), since you can pay $25, and receive $20 in change.
