Suppose you wish to build a very impressive pyramid.  But, unlike the ancient Egyptians who stacked successively smaller squares upon one another to create their pyramids, you decide to create yours out of cubes.  So, if you wanted to create a pyramid of 'height' 1, you would need 1 block.  But if you wanted to create a pyramid of 'height' 2 (that is, with 2 cubes), you would need 9 blocks, since the bottom layer would consist of a 2 by 2 by 2 cube (8 blocks) and the top layer would consist of 1 block.  Likewise, a 'height' 3 pyramid would consist of 3*3*3 (27) blocks for the bottom, 2*2*2 (8) blocks for the middle, and 1 block for the top, using a total of 27 + 8 + 1 = 36 blocks.  
You, being an ambitious architect, decide to make your pyramid using single atoms as your blocks; so you search the observable universe and come up with 2.5*10^79 atoms.  How tall a pyramid can you construct with these 2.5*10^79 blocks?  
Note that if you do not have enough blocks to complete a level, you may not count that level.  For example, if you only had 14 blocks, you could construct a complete pyramid of height 2, and begin construction on the third level; but, because you cannot complete the third level, the answer in this case would be 2.  So, what is the tallest complete pyramid of this type that you can construct with 2.5*10^79 blocks?
