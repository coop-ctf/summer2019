Suppose you find yourself in another silly country, where all transactions must be made in cash, and there are only two denominations of currency: $5 and $9.  However, giving change is illegal here, so $5 is the smallest positive amount you can pay for.  What is the largest integer amount you cannot pay for with these denominations?  Just write the number, excluding the dollar sign.  If there is no largest amount that cannot be paid for, write -1.
For example: If the denominations were $25 and $20, then the smallest amount you could pay for would be $20.  But, there would be infinitely many amounts that you could not pay for, so the answer would be -1.
